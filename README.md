# Nix Home Manager module for ASDF

## Status
Work in progress that fits my current use case

## What
A way to configure asdf using NIX and home-manager.

## Why
For times when working on projects that have not fully embraced NIX.

**NOTE**
Not all plugins are currently included but the plugin install folder is not readonly so normal ASDF plugin install should work
